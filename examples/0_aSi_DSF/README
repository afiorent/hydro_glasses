Example to generate the VDSF of MAC sample of size 10nm x 10nm and p=0.040.

Inside the p_0.040 folder there are the LAMMPS input to compute the Dynamical Matrix. in.dyn starts from mine relaxed structure (mac-relaxed.init), while in.dyn_relax also performs the relaxation starting from your original configuration.

Once the DM is ready, there are three step of post-processing:
1) Save the DM as a sparse matrix. Save memory and speed up signifantly the next step.
2) VDSF by Haydock's algorithm. 
3)VDSF by direct diagonalization: 
	3a. diagonalize the MD (only once of course)
	3b. perform quickly the computation of the VDSF. It is just a spectral decomposition.
Just for this size (~4000 atoms) step 2) could be slower than 3b. For larger size, 2) is way faster and computationally affordable. In any case this calculation should take few minutes.

Run the post-processing with
./run

These steps require some python code. You can use the github repository hydro_glass that I attach. More examples in the Material Cloud of my last two papers (The NPJ Comp. Materials and the PRB). The required python packages are specified in the hydro_glass folder. Regarding python version, I use 3.10.11, but any fairly recent version (3.8-3.10) should be fine.
